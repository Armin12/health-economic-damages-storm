# Health and Economic Damages of Storm Events

Severe weather events and storms yield both public health problems and economic damages in the society. They can cause fatalities, injuries, property, and crop damages. Preventing such outcomes is a key concern.

In this project we explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database includes characteristics of storms and weather events in the United States from the year 1950 till November 2011.

Here, we focus on the estimates of fatalities, injuries, property damage, and crop damages corresponding to each type of weather event. Specifically we calculate the total Health effect (i.e. fatalities and injuries) and the economical effects (i.e. property damage and crop damages) to determine which event impacts the most.
